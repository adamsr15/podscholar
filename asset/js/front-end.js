			abstract:		'The COVID-19 pandemic required the adoption of several health-safety practices that have been demonstrated to be crucial for limiting the spread of the virus, including the use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Particularly, face masks have become a ubiquitous component of our daily lives. However, despite their effectiveness, they have several drawbacks. In addition to being uncomfortable for many users, they entirely cover the mouth, which, in turn, poses limitations to non-verbal communication and interpersonal interaction. In this paper, we present the user-centered design process of a solution that augments face masks with additional features that support interaction, awareness, and engagement.',

			abstract:		'Given the growing success and user base of Social Media websites and, specifically, Social Networks, over the last decade, businesses have transitioned from traditional advertising to digital platforms. Specifically, their audience targeting features make it very easy to promote products and services to defined groups of individuals with specific characteristics. As a result, in addition to standard advertising, organizations, including educational institutions, started using personal and professional Social Networks (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn) as a recruiting tool for reaching potential candidates and interacting with them in a quick informal fashion. In this paper, we explore the human factors in the use of Social Media in recruiting for the Army and we detail the results of a study in which we compared the perspective of recruiters and prospect cadets, especially in the context of initiatives, such as the Delayed Entry Program (DEP).',

Despite teacher-student meetings are a crucial component of the learning experience, very little is known about office hours practices beyond the requirements of faculty and staff handbooks: attendance, utilization, and outcome are seldom reported or sparsely tracked, mostly on an individual basis, and without standards. In this paper, we introduce a novel system especially designed for educational institutions to support them in measuring and enhancing engagement with office hours and mentoring sessions.',

			abstract:		'The maximum workload range (max range) is a concept suggested by Sanders et al.1 regarding a method used to prescribe adequate practice workloads based off wearable technology data. While the example provided utilizes total distance, the max range can be applied to key performance indicators such as  high-speed distance, training load, jumps, etc. that are tracked throughout the competitive season in team sports. The max range concept was developed from research that found 12-17% of the time, football athletes, depending on position, accumulated game workloads outside their positionâ€™s mean + 1SD. Anecdotally, many coaches and practitioners use simple game averages as a control for ideal practice volumes. Based on previous research, using the game average as control training threshold may result in some high performing athletes being under-conditioned. It is reasonable to suggest that potential compound effects may occur throughout an entire season if athletes are not engaging in rigorous training loads that mimic game-like volumes and intensities.',

These guidelines have experienced very little change over the last two decades, despite significant changes in technology, more specifically wearable technology. The guidelines typical refer to exercise intensity as low, moderate and vigorous intensity based on a metabolic equivalent scale (MET) or a subjective scale. With wearable technology being accessible, affordable, reliable, and accurate, more attention should be given address recommendations that are multifaceted and specific. Most wearable technology can easily track sleep, steps, calories, hear rate, and exercise time within certain heart rate training zones. Research has shown that monitoring exercise and physical activity with wearable technology can improve health outcomes.',
