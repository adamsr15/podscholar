/*! BootScholar - the official Bootstrap flavor of PodScholar - by Michael Muzzarelli, Robert Adams, and Jyhdel Pamonag */

// BootScholar is the official PodScholar flavor of Bootstrap. Rather than importing Bootstrap and our local CSS
// separately, the Bootstrap source SCSS is imported in our Sass file and compiled alongside it. This process enables
// default variable override and extension of Bootstrap component properties to our components via the Sass @extend tag.
// One notable caveat of this approach: due to the importing of Bootstrap after variable override, Bootstrap functions
// cannot be used to assign or call variable values. This is not of great important and can safely be ignored for now.
