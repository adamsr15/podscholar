# PodScholar

PodScholar is an online content distribution platform facilitating the recording and broadcasting of scholarly research
in a more casual, digestible format: a podcast. With each podcast published, the author is granted the opportunity to
discuss the research methods and results in a more conversational tone and without the rigidity that a formal
presentation may provide. Such conversation is then encouraged between the podcast author and listeners thereof to
discuss the content and share additional resources.

PodScholar is in active development and is meant to serve as the final assignment for ASE 220, Full Stack Application
Development, at Northern Kentucky University in the Spring 2022 semester. The development team consists of
[Michael Muzzarelli](https://github.com/muzzarellimj), [Robert Adams](https://github.com/adamsr15), and
[Jyhdel Pamonag](https://github.com/jmlpamonag).
